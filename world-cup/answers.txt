Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: It seemed like the top 3 and bottom 3 changed between the numbers 1-1000 and then steadied out around 10000-100000

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I think good would be at 10000
