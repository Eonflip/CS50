# Etch-A-Sketch
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/J_BipyeeQ4g
#### Description:
<p>This is a simple etch-a-sketch project that I created alongside the curriculum for The Odin Project, it was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>Some learnings I took away from this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
  <li>Event Listeners</li>
  <li>Flexbox</li>
  <li>Color Input as an HTML element</li>
  <li>Range Selection as an HTML element</li>
</ul>
<p>My first challenge for this was getting the structure of my HTML document just right, I didn't realize there was an element you could use as a color selector (much less that you could use JavaScript to pull the value from that selector). My second challenge was making sure that the user had a slider to change the grid size, I like a slider because it's a fun element that means the user doesn't have to touch their keyboard to type in a number.</p><br>
<p>My next challenge was styling the page with CSS. I wanted the page to really stand out color wise and some of my favorite colors are blue and green. I also wanted to make sure that my flexbox skills were up to snuff so you'll notice that there's a lot of use of flexbox in my styles file.</p>
<p>Finally, the biggest challenge was writing out my logic with JavaScript using DOM Manipulation. Luckily for me, I got a really strong foundation in problem solving from this class. I think one of the things that really threw me off wasn't the DOM as much as utilizing event listeners, it took me a few tries to get the mousedrag right so that instead of just clicking one square div at a time in the etch-a-sketch, you could drag your mouse around to draw.</p>
<p>Implementing the dynamic resizing of the grid based on the slider input was another interesting challenge. It not only helped me understand the nuances of JavaScript event handling but also deepened my appreciation for responsive design. The joy of seeing the grid change size smoothly with a slide of the input was immensely satisfying.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this project that fascinated me was the integration of different modes like color, rainbow, and erase. This required a thoughtful approach to event handling and mode management, ensuring that each mode operated seamlessly and intuitively. The rainbow mode, in particular, was a fun addition that brought an extra layer of creativity to the project.</p>
<p>Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges that required a deeper dive into JavaScript's intricacies, particularly in managing state and handling complex event interactions. For instance, ensuring that drawing only occurred when the mouse was pressed down, not just when it hovered over the grid, was a subtle yet crucial aspect of functionality. It pushed me to think critically about event flow and state management within a dynamic application.</p>
<p>Optimizing the performance of the application was another area of focus. As the grid size increased, I had to ensure that the application remained responsive and efficient. This led me to explore best practices in DOM manipulation and event delegation, significantly contributing to my understanding of performance optimization in web applications.</p>
<p>Lastly, working on this project highlighted the importance of user experience design. Creating an interface that was not only functional but also intuitive and enjoyable required careful planning and iterative development. It involved refining the layout, improving the visual feedback for different modes, and ensuring that the application was accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>This project has been a milestone in my journey as a web developer. It encapsulated the challenges and triumphs of creating something interactive and user-friendly from scratch. The experience gained from this project is invaluable, and it serves as a testament to my growth and learning in the field of web development.</p>
<p>The code may not be perfectly optimized, but I plan to revisit this project as a map for how much I've learned and how far I've come. I hope that you enjoy :)</p>
